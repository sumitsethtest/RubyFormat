# A ruby format plugin for Sublime Text 2

It is not finished. I will try my best to make it better for guys who write ruby code by Sublime Text 2.

With this plugin, it's easy to format ruby code. Let your ruby code beautifully.



Now It can work on "Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4" .

I will make it to work fine on Windows and other unix like system in a few days later.
